    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Apple pie is a type of fruit pie in which the main filling ingredient is apples. 
        It is typically made by mixing peeled, cored, and sliced apples with sugar, 
        cinnamon, and other spices, and then placing the mixture into a pastry crust. 
        The crust is usually made from a combination of flour, butter, and water, and can be either a 
        traditional pie crust or a crumbly streusel topping. The pie is then baked in an oven until the 
        crust is golden brown and the apples are cooked through.
